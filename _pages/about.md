I am [Ph.D. in Engineering Systems](https://www.dsiuchile.cl/) from [Universidad de Chile](https://www.uchile.cl/). I also hold a M. Sc. in Operations Management and Industrial Engineering title from the same University.  My PhD thesis was about machine learning algorithms to support pricing and promotion decisions in the retail industry. This work was supervised by professors Marcel Goic and Andrés Musalem.

I work as [Assistant Professor](https://ingenieria.uai.cl/profesor/luis-aburto/) in the [Engineering and Sciences Faculty](https://ingenieria.uai.cl/) of the [Universidad Adolfo Ibañez](https://www.uai.cl). I love to share my work in conferences such as Informs, Euro, Marketing Science, HIS and MLDM. My main research topics are machine learning, optimization, quantitative marketing, pricing, revenue management, prescriptive analytics and category management.

During 2019, I worked in a secondment internship at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, as part of the [NeEDS Project– Network of European Data Scientists] (https://riseneeds.eu/). My research project was supervised by professors Jochen De Weerdt and Richard Weber.

In the past, I led several data science projects in [Penta Analytics](https://www.analytics.cl) applying predictive models in chilean, latin american and american companies (industries as retail, manufacturing, banking, telco and government). I developed applications for fraud control, tax evasion, customer churn detection, customer lifetime value, direct marketing and customized promotions, pricing optimization models, credit scoring, among others. 

The list of companies and institutions where I have collaborated include Yahoo, DaimlerChrysler, DMX Group, Easy, Alvi, Unimarc, Paris, Codelco, SII, Metlife, Consorcio Seguros, Walmart, Bancoestado, Enel, Chilquinta, Laureate, SAT, Falabella, La Polar, Alicorp and Sunat, among others.

Topics of interest: Pricing Optimization, Operations Management, CRM, Operations Research, Marketing research, Marketing Science, Retail Management, Pricing Models, Forecast and Demand Management.


Personal life
======
I love to play tennis and I try hard to improve my backhand and serve. I also love music. Long time ago I song in a wonderful rock band called "Rock in Progress". I love also to play guitar. I belong to [Secular Franciscan Order](https://ciofs.info/) and I am happyly married with Paloma Baytelman. These are some of the beautiful pictures I have taken during my trips.
