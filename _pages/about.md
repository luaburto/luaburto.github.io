I am [Ph.D. in Engineering Systems](https://www.dsiuchile.cl/) from [Universidad de Chile](https://www.uchile.cl/). I also hold a M. Sc. in Operations Management and Industrial Engineering title from the same University. I work as [Assistant Professor](https://ingenieria.uai.cl/profesor/luis-aburto/) in the [Engineering and Sciences Faculty](https://ingenieria.uai.cl/) of the [Universidad Adolfo Iba√±ez](https://www.uai.cl). I love to share my work in conferences such as Informs, Euro, Marketing Science, HIS and MLDM. My main research topics are machine learning, optimization, quantitative marketing, pricing, revenue management, prescriptive analytics and category management.

In the past, I led several data science projects in [Penta Analytics](https://www.analytics.cl) applying predictive models in chilean, latin american and american companies (industries as retail, manufacturing, banking, telco and government). I developed applications for fraud control, tax evasion, customer churn detection, customer lifetime value, direct marketing and customized promotions, pricing models, credit scoring, among others. 

Topics of interest: Pricing Optimization, Operations Management, CRM, Operations Research, Marketing research, Marketing Science, Retail Management, Pricing Models, Forecast and Demand Management.
